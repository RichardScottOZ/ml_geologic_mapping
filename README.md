# A.I. Assisted Geologic Mapping

This is a project that I started with my masters thesis.

My ultimate goal would be that this repository become a library of M.L trained models for different regions in the United States that anyone can download, train and use to generate geologic maps.

## Initial Dataset

I tested multiple algorithms on the task of recognizing rock units using only color differences as a starting point to building a full fledged A.I assisted geologic mapping tool. The geologic setting is the Indio Ranch area near Van Horn, Texas. The data was collected using a 3DR solo and used Pix4D to generate the orthoimagery.
